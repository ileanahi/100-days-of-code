### Day 2: August 24, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Started making my own tribute page

**Thoughts** I thought it would be easy because I had a lot of experience with HTML and CSS in the past... But, nope! I didn't get too far today. Didn't help that my sister kept distracting me with youtube videos...

**Today's Progress**: Finished my tribute page! 

**Thoughts** I'm happy with it. It took a LOT of work regarding style. I changed it so much. I might have to edit the info a bit to focus on accomplishments rather than his life.
